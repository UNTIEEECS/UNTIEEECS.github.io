## Who are you?

We are the IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Computer Society student branch at the University of North Texas. We strive to introduce students to the professional world of computing by bringing in companies to present and putting on workshops.

## When do you meet?
We meet every Tuesday at 7:00 PM in GAB 105

## Why should I come?
If you are looking to take your programming learning experience to the next level and get involved with outside class projects you should stop on by. We go to a lot of different Hackathons, bring in speakers from companies like Google and IBM, as well as just get you involved in more things that make you more desirable to companies while at the same making lots of friends.

## I'm a bad programmer I don't think I should come
Everyone starts somewhere and one of our goals is helping people learn. You do not need to be a CS major or even a STEM major to be a part of this club. We have members including officers who are not STEM and they are having a lot of fun learning!

## I can't make the meetings, how can I still be involved?
Joining our Slack server and being active on that as well as joining us for events is a great way to get involved!
