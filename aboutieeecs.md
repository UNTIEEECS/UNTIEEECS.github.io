## Who are we?
We are the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Computer Society student branch at the University of North Texas. We strive to introduce students to the professional world of computing by bringing in companies to present and put on workshops.

## When do we meet?
We meet every Tuesday at 6:00 PM, location TBD.

## Why should I come?
Stop by if you are looking to take your programming or Computer Science knowledge to the next level, or seeking out-of-class experience! We provide valuable resources such as speakers from companies like Google and IBM, information about upcoming Hackathons where you can apply and learn skills, and other events that will make you stand out to companies and connect you with new friends!

## I'm a bad programmer I don't think I should come
Everyone starts somewhere and one of our goals is helping people learn. You do not need to be a CS major or even a STEM major to be a part of this club. We have members and even officers who are not STEM and who are having a lot of fun learning!

## I can't make the meetings, can I still be involved?
Yes! Being active on our [Discord](http://discord.gg/DVxBXPJ) server as well as joining us for events is a great way to get involved!
