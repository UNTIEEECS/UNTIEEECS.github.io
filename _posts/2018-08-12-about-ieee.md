The IEEE Computer Society is the world's leading membership organization dedicated to computer science and technology. Serving more than 60,000 members, the IEEE Computer Society is the trusted information, networking, and career-development source for a global community of technology leaders that includes researchers, educators, software engineers, IT professionals, employers, and students.

The IEEE Computer Society sponsors more than 200 technical conferences and events each year, including the industry-oriented "Rock Stars" series, all over the world, aimed at research and industry professionals. Our publications are peer-reviewed, indexed, and authored by technology thought leaders worldwide, and include 17 scholarly journals and 13 magazines featuring the latest technology trends. We also offer cutting-edge products such as the myComputer app (available for iOS or Android), that provide unprecedented user-driven access to our content, and our Digital Library with more than 550,000 articles and papers spanning the full spectrum of computer science and technology.

In addition to conferences and publishing, the IEEE Computer Society is a leader in professional education and training, and has forged development and provider partnerships with major institutions and corporations internationally. These rich, self-selected, and self-paced programs help companies improve the quality of their technical staff and attract top talent while reducing costs.

We're on the cutting edge of current issues in technology, and we have a wide range of networking and volunteer leadership opportunities for our members, including over 400 local and regional chapters as well as more than 40 technical communities. We recognize our field's pioneers and visionaries through a robust awards program and work to support the next generation of technology leaders through our student scholarships.

The IEEE Computer Society is a volunteer-led organization with an active and engaged membership driving excellence at the governance levelâ€”President, Vice Presidents, and executive officers; the Board of Governors, operational Boards (such as Publications, Technical & Conference Activities, and Professional and Educational Activities), and a variety of permanent and ad hoc committees. Our publications are led by volunteer Editors-in-Chief and editorial boards. All these activities are supported by a professional staff, led by an Executive Director, with offices in Washington, DC and Southern California.  IEEE offices in Tokyo, China, India and Singapore also lend support for Society activities. 

The IEEE Computer Society is the community for technology leaders. As the computing professional's single, unmatched source for technology information, inspiration and collaboration, we are the organization that computing's leaders, innovators, and researchers trust.
