# [HackTX](https://hacktx.com/)

October 28th-29th

*Whether you’re new to hackathons or are a hackathon wizard level 500, we welcome hackers of all levels of experience. For hackathon newbies, we’ll host workshops to help you figure out a potential project (music visualizer, anyone?). As always, you’ll have mentors to guide you through even the simplest of tasks, such as setting up your development environment or learning git commands.*
